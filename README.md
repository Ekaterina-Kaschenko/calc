### begin:
We are living in a modern world, but use Babel and PostCSS for transpile our modern code into an old to support some shitty browsers such as IE.

This project will not use Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, autoprefixer, etc. to support non-modern browsers.  
Be modern, be free of transpilers - use the cool and modern browsers!

### end:
This is a simple calculator.
